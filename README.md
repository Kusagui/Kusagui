# Hi, ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Carlos
I am a passionate Frontend web developer with experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, I work in the Marketing department of a software consulting firm, where I am responsible for designing email layouts for marketing campaigns and occasionally collaborating on web development for A/B testing for CRO. I am also particularly interested in learning about technologies such as React and Next.js to improve the scalability and performance of web applications.
